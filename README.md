# Incident Report & Remediation README for yummyrecipesforme.com

## Overview

This document provides a detailed account of the security breach that occurred at yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. It covers the method of the attack, the analysis of the malicious activity, and recommendations to prevent future security incidents.

## Incident Summary

A former employee conducted a cyber attack on yummyrecipesforme.com by performing a brute force attack to access the web host. By exploiting weak administrative password policies, the attacker gained unauthorized access, modified the website's source code to include malicious JavaScript, and redirected users to a malware-infested clone of the site.

### Details of the Attack

- **Method of Entry:** The attacker used a brute force attack to guess the admin panel password, which was set to a default.
- **Malicious Activity:** Upon gaining access, the attacker embedded JavaScript that prompted users to download a malicious executable file. Running this file resulted in the user's browser being redirected to a fake version of the website (`greatrecipesforme.com`), which contained malware.
- **Impact:** Users reported slow computer performance and unauthorized changes to their system after visiting the website and downloading the file.

### Technical Breakdown

1. **Initial Breach**
   - **Protocol Used:** HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
   - **Attack Vector:** Brute force attack to exploit weak default passwords

2. **Malware Distribution**
   - **Protocols Used:** 
     - DNS (Domain Name System) to resolve `yummyrecipesforme.com` and `greatrecipesforme.com`
     - HTTP to download the malware and to redirect to the malicious site

3. **Execution of Malware**
   - Malware initiated further DNS requests and HTTP requests to connect to and interact with `greatrecipesforme.com`.

## Security Flaws Identified

1. **Weak Password Policies:** Use of default passwords and lack of account lockout policies enabled the brute force attack.
2. **Insufficient Monitoring:** Lack of detection mechanisms for unusual login attempts or modifications to website source code.

## Recommendations for Security Enhancements

1. **Implement Strong Password Policies:**
   - Enforce complex password creation rules.
   - Require periodic password changes.

2. **Brute Force Attack Mitigation:**
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms after several failed login attempts.
   - Use captcha to distinguish between bots and humans during the login process.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts.
   - Monitor and log all changes made to the websiteâ€™s source code.

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct periodic security audits to ensure compliance with security policies.
   - Regularly update systems and software to patch known vulnerabilities.

5. **Employee Security Awareness Training:**
   - Regular training on cybersecurity best practices and phishing awareness for all employees.

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures, especially for systems accessible over the internet. Implementing the recommended security measures will help prevent similar incidents in the future and protect both the integrity of the website and the security of its users.
